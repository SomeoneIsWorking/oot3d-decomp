# Porting OoT3D Link's player code into SoH3D — plan & journal

Goal (user directive 2026-06-21): **SoH3D Link should BE 3DS Link** — port OoT3D's actual player
behaviors, not just swap the model/CSAB onto N64 `z_player.c`. The N64 logic mismatching the 3DS
assets is what produces the long tail of Link bugs (walk-stop torso snap, run-off-edge jump, weird
yawn, sword-on-back before owning it, pickup snapping to torso then above head, door-exit slide,
higher-surface climb teleport). User chose **literal decompile of `z_player.cpp`** as the approach.

## The accelerator: N64 `z_player.c` is the Rosetta stone
OoT3D `z_player.cpp` (source path `z_player.cpp`) is
Grezzo's 3DS port of the SAME player code SoH already has fully decompiled and readable at
`Shipwright/soh/src/overlays/actors/ovl_player_actor/z_player.c` (939 functions, 16.8k lines).
So we do NOT decompile blind ARM: for each OoT3D function we (1) Ghidra-decompile the ARM to C,
(2) align it to its N64 twin by structure/call-graph, (3) diff to isolate Grezzo's CHANGES, and
(4) port the OoT3D behavior into SoH3D's Player path. The divergences ARE the fixes.

## Tooling (the decompilation surface)
- **Ghidra 11.0.3** (`/opt/ghidra_11.0.3_PUBLIC`) — headless project at `build/ghidra/oot3d`
  (gitignored). Import: `code.bin`, `ARM:LE:32:Cortex`, base `0x00100000`. This is the only
  reliable function-boundary + C decompiler for this mixed ARM/Thumb-2 image (capstone linear
  sweeps desync — see static_decomp.md).
  - Re-run analysis: `analyzeHeadless build/ghidra oot3d -import build/code.bin -processor ARM:LE:32:Cortex -loader BinaryLoader -loader-baseAddr 0x100000`
  - Decompile: `OOT3D_REPO=$PWD analyzeHeadless build/ghidra oot3d -process code.bin -noanalysis -scriptPath tools/ghidra_scripts -postScript DecompDump.py`
    (no DECOMP_TARGETS → writes `build/decomp/functions.csv` inventory; with a targets file of hex
    vaddrs → writes `build/decomp/<vaddr>.c`).
- Live oracle (Azahar) to verify each ported behavior frame-accurately (`tools/link_*`).
- N64 reference: `Shipwright/soh/src/overlays/actors/ovl_player_actor/z_player.c`.

## Known anchors (verified live / RE'd this project)
- **Player actor**: id 0, instance ~0x098f4010; `gPlayState @ 0x0050AF34`.
- **Player_Update** ≈ `0x001e1b54` (actor `update` fn ptr @ instance+0x13C — confirm vs Ghidra).
- **Player struct (partial, verified live):** pos@+0x08 (Vec3f), rot@+0x14 (Vec3s), params@+0x1C;
  embedded skeleton obj @+0x25c (vtable 0x4ec030) → anim-player @+0x20 (vtable 0x4ec018);
  **base-anim controller IN instance:** morphWeight@+0x288, morphRate@+0x28c (=1/morphFrames),
  curFrame@+0x290, playSpeed@+0x294 (see anim_system.md). Bone map: link_bone_map.md.
- **The MORPH** (already RE'd): OoT3D cross-fades transitions linearly via morphWeight 1.0→0 over
  morphFrames — same model as N64 SkelAnime; the SoH3D 3d3 path just never applies it.

## Bug → behavior → N64 function (decompile these OoT3D twins first)
| reported bug | N64 function family (start here) |
|---|---|
| walk-stop torso snap; run-off-edge jump | locomotion action funcs + the morph; Player_Action_Run/Idle, jump/ledge |
| weird yawn (idle fidget) | `Player_StartMode_Idle` + idle-anim picker |
| sword on back before owning it | equipment draw / `Player_OverrideLimbDraw`, equip flags, sheath visibility |
| pickup snaps to torso → above head | `Player_UpperAction_CarryActor` + carried-actor placement in `Player_DrawImpl` |
| door-exit slide | door action func (sDoorAction / Player door state) |
| higher-surface climb teleport | wall-climb action func (climb mount/advance) |

## Phased plan
0. **Pipeline up** (this session): Ghidra analyzed; DecompDump.py; function inventory; decompile
   Player_Update + the action dispatch; confirm the OoT3D player state machine layout.
1. **Map** the OoT3D player functions ↔ N64 names (call-graph + structure align). Durable table.
2. **Port behavior-by-behavior**, each: decompile OoT3D twin → diff vs N64 → port into SoH3D Player
   path → verify in real gameplay (user playtests) + oracle frame-compare. Faithful first.
3. Only after faithful: any enhancement.

## Log
- 2026-06-21: pipeline stood up; Ghidra headless analysis launched on code.bin. (this entry)
